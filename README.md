* Try to answer all the questions before time runs out. Your score will be shown when the timer hits 0 or you click the submit button.

* I struggled a lot with this, I went about it the completely wrong way by making all my questions in the actual HTML of the page, then tried hiding/showing all the questions but then realized trying to score the quiz this way was going to be EXTREMELY difficult. So I ended up changing the whole thing around in one day to get it working properly. I still can't quite figure out how to calculate unanswered questions, though.
